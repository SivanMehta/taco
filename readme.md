These guides are probably longer than they needs to be. But I like to ramble, so please humor me.

## Versions

There are 2 versions of this guide, they largely cover the same information, but differ slightly given where you're taking care of him:

- [Home](./home.md) - If you're taking care of him at my apartment.
- [Away](./away.md) - If you're taking care of him at your place.
