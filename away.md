# Food

![](food-bowls.png)

I feed him Fancy Feast cans for all meals, and occasionally give him treats whenever I (attempt to) teach him tricks. I also keep dry food in the left bowl mostly topped off so he can graze whenever he is feeling peckish. If you're hanging out with him in the hour or two before he gets fed, he WILL start meowing at you to feed him. If you can, feed him on time, but it's ok to cave if your schedule (or your heart) conflicts.

- Breakfast: 1/2 can @ ~8:30 am
- Dinner: 1/2 can @ ~6:30 pm
  - *All of these times can be + or - a few hours to better fit your schedule*

The Fancy Feast that he eats is readily available at most grocery stores in the pet section. I will provide you with enough to more than last through his stay with you, but if I miscalculated and didn't leave enough, please get more and Venmo me in the cost (@Sivan-Mehta).

## Stimulation

![](lol.png)

Cats are very good at occupying themselves, but they are still social. You don't need to do a whole lot except spend time with him. If you want to play with him, his favorite toys are the laser pointer and the lure. A good rule of thumb is that he _loves_ chasing things that hide. For example: the lure isn't interesting if it's dangling in front of face. The lure _is_ interesting if it flits back and forth around corners. There are also approximately 85 million videos online on "how to play with a cat" if you're in need of inspiration. A great rule of thumb is to match his energy. So if you notice he's got the _zoomies_, that's a great time to let him express his inner apex predator.

Additionally, he loves climbing through tight spaces. I often will find him hiding under the bed, on the top shelf of a closet, burrowed into a pile of clothes, or rooting around in the latest box that has been brought into the house. I will also provide a few toys for you to use.

If you're cooking, he will start meowing at you to give him food. He's not hungry, he just wants to be involved. 99% of the time, he just wants a sniff of what you're working with, and he'll leave you alone once he's had a sniff. If you want to actually give him something to snack on, the rule of thumb is that he can _only_ have unseasoned, cooked meat. Cats are allergic to nearly every spices and seasonings, so please don't give him anything that's been seasoned. If you don't have any of raw uncooked meat lying around, a very easy treat is a small dab of peanut butter.

Alternatively, you can discourage this behavior by letting him sniff something that he HATES. These include garlic, citrus, and onions.

### Boundaries

Taco is an indoor cat, so as much as he may try, do not let him escape. He will often greet me at the front door and immediately try to escape, so just be wary whenever you're coming in. He's basically an overgrown baby, and has not learned any skills that would keep him safe in life outside. The flip side of this is if he *does* escape, he will be very easy to catch, as he rarely ventures more than a few feet from the front door.

As a cat, he will love any windows that he has access to, particularly those with elevated vantage points. He will often spend hours on end just staring out the window. This is as close to he gets to exploring the great outdoors.

Scratching is an innate behavior to cats and is a way for them to mark their territory. If he starts scratching yours, pick him up and place him on the scratch pad I will provide you. That way he will learn to direct the instinct in a specific direction.

## Odds and Ends

Tacocat is a very clean cat, and will meticulously groom himself. throughout the day. I'll provide you with a litterbox and a few weeks worth of litter. General rule of thumb is to *always* have the litter box available for him to use. Scooping the litter box is a daily chore, and I'll provide you with a scooper. Scooping also provides you with a good opportunity to check on his health. If you notice that he's not using the litter box, or that he's using anything else as a bathroom, please let me know ASAP.

As a cat, he's an [extremely sleepy boi](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/syQCUC0mva8) and will sleep upwards of 16+ hours a day if you let him. During the day, he has an uncanny ability to find the sunniest spot in the apartment and just conk out. At night, he may even try sleep on the bed with you, aiming mostly to curl up on your torso. If you're not a fan of this, you can gently move him off of you, and he'll find a new spot to sleep.
