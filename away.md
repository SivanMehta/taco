# Food

![](food-bowls.png)

I feed him Fancy Feast cans for all meals, and occasionally give him treats whenever I (attempt to) teach him tricks. I also keep dry food in the left bowl mostly topped off so he can graze whenever he is feeling peckish. If you're hanging out with him in the hour or two before he gets fed, he WILL start meowing at you to feed him. If you can, feed him on time, but it's ok to cave (or your heart) if your schedule conflicts.

- Breakfast: 1/2 can of Fancy Feast @ ~8:30am
- Dinner: 1/2 can @ ~6:30pm
  - *All of these times can be + or - a few hours to better fit your schedule*

The Fancy Feast that he eats is readily available at most grocery stores in the pet section. I will provide you with enough to more than last through his stay with you, but if I miscalculated and didn't leave enough, please get more and Venmo me in the cost (@Sivan-Mehta).

## Stimulation

Cats are very good at occupying themselves, but they are still social. You don't need to do a whole lot except spend time with him. This can accompany meal times, or whenever you're in the neighborhood. If you want to play with him, his favorite toys are the laser pointer and the lure. A good rule of thumb is that he _loves_ chasing things that hide. For example: the lure isn't interesting if it's dangling in front of face. The lure _is_ interesting if it flits back and forth around corners. There are also approximately 85 million videos online on "how to play with a cat" if you're in need of inspiration. 

Additionally, he loves climbing through tight spaces. I often will find him hiding under the bed, on the top shelf of a closet, burrowed into a pile of clothes, or rooting around in the latest box that has been brought into the house. I will also provide a few toys for you to use, the massage gun is a new addition that he's surprisingly quite taken with.

If you're cooking, he will start meowing at you to give him food. He's not hungry, he just wants to be involved. 99% of the time, he just wants a sniff of what you're working with, and he'll leave you alone once he realizes its something he hates (which is 99% of things). If you want to actually give him something to snack on, the general rule is that he can _only_ have unseasoned, cooked meat. Cats are allergic to large amount of spices and seasonings, so please don't give him anything that's been seasoned. This includes _any_ dairy, as he's lactose intolerant.

Alternatively, you can discourage this behavior by letting him sniff something that he HATES. These include garlic, citrus, and onions.

### Boundaries

Taco is an indoor cat, so as much as he may try, don't let him escape out the front door. He will often greet us at the door and immediately try to go out the door so just be wary whenever you're coming in. He's basically an overgrown baby, and has not learned any skills that would keep him safe in life outside.

As a cat, he will love any windows that he has access to, particularly those with elevated vantage points. He will often spend hours on end just staring out the window. I'll provide you with a perch you can suction onto a window, he'll be all over it. This is as close to he gets to exploring the great outdoors.

## Odds and Ends

Tacocat is a very clean cat, and will meticulously groom himself. I'll provide you with a litterbox and a few weeks worth of litter. General rule of thumb is to *always* have the litter box available for him to use. Scooping the litter box is a daily chore, and I'll provide you with a scooper. Scooping also provides you with a good opportunity to check on his health. If you notice that he's not using the litter box, or that he's using anything else as a bathroom, please let me know ASAP.

As a cat, he's also an [extremely sleepy boi](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/syQCUC0mva8). He will sleep upwards of 16+ hours a day if you let him. During the day, he has an uncanny ability to find the sunniest spot in the apartment. He may try sleep in the bed with you, aiming mostly to curl up on your torso. If you're not a fan of this, you can gently move him off of you, and he'll find a new spot to sleep.
